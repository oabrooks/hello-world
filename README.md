# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the Github flow.
Hello, my name is Olivia. I am a Clinical Research Coordinator with the Center for Respiratory Virus Research & Response (MCRVRR) and the Michigan Public Health Integrated Center for Outbreak Analytics & Modeling (MICOM) at the University of Michigan, School of Public Health. I have never used Github before, and am currently following a tutorial for learning how to create my first repository. And most importantly, I am very sleepy today, but am being very brave about it.
